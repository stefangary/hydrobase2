This text file documents how to
add a new property to HB2.

List all available properties with
hb_propcalc -P

If it's not there, then:

1) Decide on a two character ID
   dt/dp = tp, dt/dz = tz

2) In the file hydrobase.h,

      + Augment variable MAXPROP by one (or however many properties to add).
      + Add the 2 char ID (capitalized) to the list property{}.

3) In the file prop_subs.c

      + Add the 2 char ID (in the same order as in hydrobase.h) to the
	list prop_mne{}.
      + Add the property description to prop_descrip{}.
      + Add the property units to prop_units{}.
      + Add the field width to field_width{}.
      + Add to field_precis{}.
      + Add to the case statement in the function get_prop_indx()
      + Add or modify one of the compute_*() functions in this file.
	    For the case of TP, added compute_dtdp()

4) Allow this quantity to be computed in the case list whereever
   multiple properties are computed.
